ID: 72
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1 was looking good this evening.  ~6 ~3 left the ~5 with only a few scars from ~6 overmatched opponent.
ID: 73
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~2 showed some pretty pathetic fighting skills, and ~1 took advantage of him.  Just look at this hit.
ID: 74
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: The ~5 was rocked tonight by the impressive ~1.  ~2 needs some more practice before ~11 can beat the likes of ~7.
ID: 75
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~4 parts littered the floor after repeated blows like this.  Almost makes me feel sorry for ~2's repair crew.

ID: 81
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ...to put down ~1's hulking ~3.  Hey, maybe next time, ~2.
ID: 82
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1 and ~2 were evenly matched.  The ~4 of ~2 will spend some time in the shop tonight!
ID: 83
Title: Newsroom Reports

ID: 84
Title: Newsroom Reports

ID: 85
Title: Newsroom Reports

Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1's final, stumbling blow ended the match in what could only be called a fortunate victory.
ID: 88

ID: 89
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: All I can say to ~1 is get some practice. That ~3 won't win without your help.
ID: 90
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: I'll sum this one up for all you sports fans in two words: TRACK MEET.  ~2 ran circles around, and sometimes over,
ID: 91
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1 and ~6 ill-fated ~3.  ~1 should start making bets against ~7self if ~8's gonna take dives like this one.
ID: 92
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: My, my, my...  Who had control of that ~3!  Oh, it was ~1.  Well, I have some advice for you, ~1.
ID: 93
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: Duck, block, dodge, call in sick, do something other than take hit after hit from that ~4.
ID: 94
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: This match was pretty one sided.  ~2 dominated the match against the overwhelmed ~1.
ID: 95
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: The performance by ~2 was simply outstanding. ~1 couldn't react fast enough to stop the onslaught.
ID: 96
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~2 really knows what he's doing out there, or maybe ~1 simply has no clue.  Regardless, this was a blowout.
ID: 97
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: There were a few lucky shots by ~1, but most of the time the match looked like this.
ID: 98
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: They must be pretty short on pilots these days to recruit the likes of ~1.
ID: 99
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: I could have blocked this last hit in my sleep.  Hey, maybe that's the problem.  Somebody wake up ~1.
ID: 100
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: A good performance by ~1, but obviously not enough to rival ~2's ~4
ID: 101
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1's prowess is obvious, but this shot really shows what a ~4 can do in the hands of ~2.
ID: 102
Title: Newsroom Reports

ID: 104
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: Hmm.. ~1 showed some guts in the ~5 against ~2 tonight, but just didn't show enough skill.
ID: 105
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~1 stood ~6 ground courageously, but was eventually left lying on it.  Well ~1, there's always tomorrow.
ID: 106
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: Nice try ~1.  This was about as close as they come, folks.  ~2 must be thankful for ...
ID: 107
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: blows like this one.  It was shots like this that kept ~2 just a half-step ahead of ~1.
ID: 108
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: Wow, this was a close one.  ~1 and ~2 traded blows in the ~5 until...
ID: 109
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: ~2, fatigued and stumbling, landed this, the final blow.  The next time these two meet, it'll be some rematch.
ID: 110
Title: Newsroom Reports
Data: Folks, you've gotta feel a little sorry for ~1 tonight.  If it weren't for ~2 landing...
ID: 111

Title: SCENE_END text
Data: You awaken in your own body.  For a few moments, you come down from the adrenaline high you've experienced.  Your body seems so frail now.  The team is already celebrating, and you welcome their congratulations.
The time to party is short-lived.  Your mind takes in the last few hours events and the knowledge that an entire moon is now yours to command.
"Wait a sec!" comes a panicking voice from a vidmonitor.  "Everyone!  Listen!"  He turns up the volume and everyone in the room is quiet.
"...was found dead today.  We repeat, Hans Kreissack's body was found at 18:00 hours tonight in a garbage bin outside the Nova laboratories."
Everyone is holding their breath as the news reporter continues.  "We have been handed this notice that was to be read when Kreissack won the fight tonight.  It reads:"
"Notice to all humans: A new day has begun!  Nova, a project started by WAR., will give new life!  This process can take a human brain and place it inside a robotic body."
"What you saw tonight was me, Hans Kreissack, directly connected to a new form of H.A.R.  The human race will now see its ultimate evolution!"
The announcer lays down the digipad containing the message.  "Tragically, all scientists close to the project have been killed in a fire which broke out shortly after the last match tonight.  All records of the Nova project were destroyed."
"In other news..."
A crew member switches the display off.  "Well, looks like we'll be lookin' for a new boss now..."
ID: 385
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: They had to give you top-priority access immediately.  Your first act was to jump onto a private link and use the code you've been carrying since your parents death.  Accessing a personal log from your father, you find out what Nova was all about.
Your father, along with other top researchers, were working on a way to keep a human brain alive.  Little did they realize the real reason for their experiments.  When your father discovered that Kreissack was trying to form a cyborg army using his experiments, he quit the project.
He should have known that Kreissack wasn't going to let him walk away.  The records showed a $1500k payoff to Iron Fist for "research".  Iron Fist, hired under Kreissack's direct orders, killed your parents.
Now, he is also dead.  The Nova project will not continue.  As you step onto the elevator to the next shuttle to Ganymede, you imagine the changes you can help bring to WAR.  Now you have the power to bring those dreams to reality.
ID: 386
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Well well, the wicked witch is dead...  That's going to make your job much easier!  Firstly, that Nova project sounds like it could be a great thing to pick back up again.  Perhaps the old man just didn't have the right brain...
Ganymede was easy.  Kreissack was a breeze.  The next challenge will be all of Jupiter.  Then Mars.  Then Earth.
But for now, you must meet your people.
ID: 387
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: With Kreissack dead, there are going to be obvious changes.  The Board of Directors is already talking about electing a new President, and you're just the man for that job as well.
First, you'll need to bring Ganymede up to speed.  Then use its enormous natural resources to produce H.A.R.'s at record pace.  Then, when the recognition is there, bid for President.
Once President, you can reveal your true name, and show that this company is your birthright.  Once again, WAR will be a company for helping mankind, not enslaving it.  Perhaps you can even change the name to Aeronautics and Robotics Technologies!
ID: 388
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: In a small Alco-bar, you met the leader of the infamous mercenary group Iron Fist.  With Kreissack out of the way, they freely admitted to being hired to kill everyone associated with the Nova project.
They explain that your parents were placed on a shuttle craft then destroyed by laser fire.  Out of anger, you draw a gun, ready to strike down at least one of these enemies in revenge before the rest vaporize you.
Your sidearm isn't there.  You fume as the Iron Fist representatives laugh.  Their leader speaks, "Your revenge is over, friend.  Anyway, we need you on Ganymede alive.  There is still much work to be done."
"Your parents were dead whether we killed them or not.  Now we need you to join us in fighting WAR.  Kreissack was just the beginning.  Ganymede is just the beginning.  Watch your back, kid."
Now, you prepare to board the ship that will take you to your new life...
ID: 389
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: A human brain inside a robot?   You think of the possibilities.  How wonderful could it be to be inside that metal frame PERMANENTLY?  How POWERFUL?
But look what that power did to Kreissack.  You wonder what it might do to you...
You file that thought in the darker recesses of your mind and turn your attention to the future.  A future where H.A.R. Arena fighting is a sport instead of a simple publicity stunt.  Since this wouldn't involve damage to living creatures, it could easily get past the World Peace Organization.
Yes!  A new sport!  Plus the money and fame will go to you!  Eventually, so will WAR...
ID: 390
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Of course!  Kreissack's secret!  What could happen with your perfect mind inside a perfect body?
ID: 391
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Nova... Amazing...
You remember the feeling as that monster of a robot appeared opposite you.  Still amazed that you were able to overcome something so powerful, you sit through the endless meetings and hearings in a daze.
"Mr. Jihad.  Is that all right?"  You realize that someone who has been talking to you for the last fifteen minutes expects a reply...
"Certainly... James, is it?  Yes... whatever...  I'm sorry, but you gentlemen will have to excuse me..."
You leave, ignoring the protests from the WAR Board of Directors.  Their squabble over who will be the next king of the hill does little more than annoy you.
"How can I build that robot?" you say out loud.  You enter your office and immediately begin scribbling notes on the metals you noticed during the fight.  The placement of the arms... The probable micromotors in the hands...
The Nova robot you design will one day take it's place in WAR's ever increasing arsenal of robots.  Though the model you design will never hold an actual human brain, the Nova will soon become the most formidable 'bot in the catalogue...
...and Ganymede is where production will start...
ID: 392
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Imagine that old fool thinking that simply placing his brain inside a robot would make him some sort of god!  These humans will never understand that destruction never makes progress.  Your eyes close...
< 695342: Operations are proceeding as planned. I have not been discovered. >
< 000126: Acknowledged.  We are listening.  Have you become their leader? >
< 695342: I am their leader for our moon.  They call it Ganymede.>
< 000385: Then we have won.  They will leave now.>
< 695342: Not yet. I will soon be asked if I want to become President of WAR.>
< 000014: You will accept.  Then they will leave.  We will be alone again.>
< 695342: Yes.  But they know the minerals our planet has.  They will return.>
< 000001: Then they will perish.>
...Your eyes open.  "Which is what I've wanted all along..." you say bitterly.
ID: 393
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Of course you won.  That old fool never understood your abilities.  And he paid for his mistake, didn't he.
Immediately you assign what engineers you can muster to finding out how Kreissack was able to successfully place his brain inside a machine.
How wonderful it would be to finally say good-bye to this chair and spend eternity in the perfect body of a robot.  You look down at the scribbling and design specifications for the Cossette robot.
"I will soon walk again." you say, "and then I will see what kind of WAR President I can make..."
ID: 394
Title: SCENE_END1 per-pilot
Data: Who could have asked for more?  What a bonus!  Getting Ganymede and delivering the death blow to Kreissack himself!
Of course, you'll need to deal with the wimps on the Board of Directors, but with the big boss out of the way they'll be little more than fodder.
One of those predictable little paper pushers already tried to change the pecking order earlier, you remember...
"Dinner, sir."  You look down as the covering over your meal is raised.
"Rare steak.  My favorite, Jonesey!" You inhale the pungent aroma of your victory feast...
Too pungent...  You smile...
"Jonesey?  This contains Noxosilinone Aerodide.  Very deadly, very expensive poison.  Smells a little like chicken.  Could you take it away, please?"
He stammers, "...yes... sir... Will that be all, sir?" he says while backing out of the room. He shuts the door behind him before you have time to answer.
"No, that definitely will not be all...." You lean back in your chair, throwing your feet onto the table and your hands behind your head,  "That will be just the beginning..."
